        <h2>About the author</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Héctor (my friends call me Hatch), and at the time of starting this archive I am 25 years old and living in Spain, where I am from.</p>

        <p>I started a degree in Philosophy at university, but a series of traumatic interpersonal events led to the decision to drop out of the courses during my final year. Life since then has been an uphill battle of reminding myself of the beauty of
            the world, and trying to stay alive to experience it.</p>
        <p>That is, in part, why I started archiving all the things that move me. There's also a part of me that's terrified of how ephemeral everything is in a corporate digital age and I hope that something will live on once I'm gone, and makes other Earthlings
            remember that we were here, and we loved this place and its creatures.</p>

        <p>For an age where these words mean anything: I am transmasculine. I am gay. I am an anarchist. I benefit from the crimes of a colonial nation. I am physically disabled (low vision) and mentally ill.</p>
        <p>For an age where they don't: I am many of the things that humans of this world can be, but I wish to be remembered, first and foremost, as someone who lived on Earth and loved humanity in a time where it was impossible to hide from the fact that
            Earth as I knew it was in its dying days.</p>
